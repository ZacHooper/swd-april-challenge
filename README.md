# April - ReBrand

Your challenge this month is to re-brand the following visual in the style of your choosing. You can download the [data and this graph](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RapCShg2T_NqqmEIp1xwcdMkCsaGU9ud/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108740421349789704995&rtpof=true&sd=true) and execute in your preferred tool of choice.

# Brand

Based soley on the fact that I played the game this morning I am going to rebrand the chart as if it were a [Super Auto Pets](https://teamwoodgames.com) chart.

Super Auto Pets is a “chill auto battler” where you pit teams of pets with different abilities against other players. The goal is to win 10 matches but you only have 10 lives to do so. The game was created by [Teamwood Games](https://teamwood.itch.io).

The game has a very cute children’s cartoon style, akin to Pokemon or My Fairy God Parents. The cute thick lined pet illustrations combined with the loud and colourful typography creates a very fun and inviting game.

# Chart Idea

The dataset provides categorised data, which I want to pretend corresponds to the amount of times a certain pet is used. Rather than dollar amounts the value’s will represent the number of times a certain pet was selected. If this was real data, this chart could be used to if certain pets are overpowered (high pick count) or underpowered (low pick count).

The will only display 10 bars but Super Auto Pets has many more than 10 pets, so it will be assumed that the chart is using the top 10 most selected pets.

### Audience

- Developers who determine the balance of the game.
- Play testers

## Colours

Orange → R: 237, G: 115, B: 46 `rgb(237,115,46)`

Font Orange → R: 93, G: 36, B: 11 `rgb(93, 36, 11)`

Blue → R: 12, G: 38, B: 56 `rgb(12, 38, 56)`

Dark Blue → R: 8, G: 30, B: 46 `rgb(8, 30, 46)`

Red → R: 148, G: 34, B: 19 `rbg(148, 34, 19)`

Dark Red → R: 57, G: 5, B: 11 `rgb(57, 5, 11)`

Yellow → R: 245, G: 192, B: 66 `rgb(245, 192, 66)`

Black → R: 0, G: 0, B: 0

White → R: 255, G: 255, B:255

The two major colours are the orange for accents and blue for background. The dark orange is used for text on the orange areas and white for the blue areas.

As yellow is the main colour in the logo it can likely be used for accentuatating a particular point of interest.

We won’t use red as it’s simply used to signify a “cross” or cancel button.

## Font

The font used on the website is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato#about).

The ingame font is likely a custom font. Putting it through a font identifier doesn’t find a match but the closets identified was [Riky](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/riky/regular/). Regardless the ingame font isn’t useful for the chart as it’s flashiness would distract from the important information in the chart.

## Iconography add

The game credits several authors for the icons in the game, notably the [Google Font icons](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji).

### Inspiration

Lorena Mendez submitted this chart for this challenge actually. I like how the logos of each brand are placed on top of each bar. You could place them on the x ticks however, the logo allows you to associate each bar with each account incredibly quickly.

Some feedback that was provided for this chart was to place the logos on the x ticks. This could be a good idea so that rather than words the logos are at the bottom.

# Data

### Which Pets?

This is mock data so I can choose any pets I want however, to provide some realism I will use all the tier 1 pets as they would actually be the most likely to be picked the most. To add some interest and “insight” to the chart I will add a couple of “surprising” tier 2 & 3 pets.

Listing them now means I can source only these pet’s images.

# Creating the Plot

I will be using the Python library [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) to create this plot. I have never added images to a plot using Matplotlib so this will be a good learning exercise for me.

I recreated the dataset in a Pandas Dataframe.

```python
pets = ["fish","ant","mosquito","otter","beaver",
        "horse","cricket","swan","spider","snail"]

times_used = [547262, 294164, 190473, 86734,
              43986, 21856, 18496, 15753,
              11985, 11645]

data = pd.DataFrame({"pet": pets, "times_used": times_used})
```

I then created the figure and plot

```python
# Create figure and plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(8, 6))
```

Following this I updated the fonts for the chart so that I could use ‘Lato’. This was surprisngly difficult to achieve and required clearing my font cache via the terminal to actually get Matplotlib to use the Lato font in the plot.

```python
# Set font family globally
rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'
rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Lato']
rcParams['font.size'] = 16
rcParams['font.weight'] = 'regular'
rcParams["figure.titleweight"] = 'black'
```

Next I plotted the actual bars of the pets to the plot. The colours of each bar corresponded to the primary colours of each pet. So for example the fish had a blue bar and the ant a grey bar.

```python
# Plot bars
ax.barh(data=data.sort_values(by="times_used"), 
        y="pet", 
        width="times_used", 
        color=["#A05D43", "#868686", "#E1E8ED", "#9C7866", "#FEAF5F", 
				 "#B38A6D", "#6E4D44", "#77A8AF", "#868686", "#00B1FF"])
```

Next up is to style the chart. I capitalised the pet names to look more professional. I shortened the number values to XXXk to make then simpler. I removed the top and right spines of the plot so that the plot was neater and finally I coloured the remaining spines and all the text with the dark blue of the Super Auto Pets brand.

```python
# Style Chart
ax.set_yticklabels(data.sort_values(by="times_used").pet.apply(str.capitalize), color="#081E2E")
ax.set_xticklabels(["0", "100k", "200k", "300k", "400k", "500k", "600k"], color="#081E2E")
ax.set_xlim(0,600000)
ax.set_title("The Fish, Ant & Mosquito account for 83% of the pets selected", 
             horizontalalignment="left", x=-0.16, color="#081E2E", size="medium")
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['left'].set_color("#081E2E")
ax.spines['bottom'].set_color("#081E2E")
```

Now it’s time to add the icons for each pet to the plot. I wanted the icon to sit slightly to the right of their bar. As the process was the same for each pet icon I created a function to add the image and then looped over the dataframe adding each icon to the plot. There was slight tweaking required to get the zoom and distance to the right just how I wanted it.

```python
# Add Pet Icons
def add_pet_image(pet_name, times_used, index):
    img = mpimg.imread(f'images/{pet_name}.png')
    imagebox = OffsetImage(img, zoom=0.9)
    abox = AnnotationBbox(imagebox, (times_used + 30000, 9 - index), frameon=False)
    ax.add_artist(abox)

data.apply(lambda row: add_pet_image(row.pet, row.times_used, row.name), axis=1)
```

The final image to add is the Super Auto Pets logo. This is the primary indicator that this chart belongs to the Super Auto Pets brand. I felt it looked best being in the bottom right of the plot.

```python
# Add Logo
img_logo = mpimg.imread('images/logo.png')
imagebox_logo = OffsetImage(img_logo, zoom=1)
abox_logo = AnnotationBbox(imagebox_logo, (500000, 1), frameon=False)
ax.add_artist(abox_logo)
```

Finally, I needed to add a title and save the complete figure.

```python
# Figure Styling
fig.suptitle("Tier 1 Pets make up the majority of the most used pets.", horizontalalignment="left", x=0, color="#081E2E")

fig.savefig('sap_bar.png')
fig.show()
```

# Final Output

I’m very happy with the output. I believe it looks quite professional and would fit in a Super Auto Pets presentation well.

![sap_bar.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/8415e1ba-419e-30b2-76b7-c0726032bc86/doc/4C272A2B-454D-49C9-BB9B-CA17041032D9/13993DBE-05F7-41AC-9470-56D5922337E9_2/I8T3nHGYczZpUyud8D6P3jPrKUhd2NDFt7C4XOsvISkz/sap_bar.png)

# Final Thoughts

If I were to spend more time on this plot I think trying to make it more childlike could really bring it up a notch and really be inline with the Super Auto Pets brand, however, that would require some serious editing and posisble not be worth the time to work out in Matplotlib but rather design in Illustrator.
